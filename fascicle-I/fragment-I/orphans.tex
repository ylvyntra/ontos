\section{Orphan Paragraphs}

$F$ indeed affords the material of a very important symbolic substrate that is,
simultaneously, a routing mechanism for $F$ to interact with Human
Interlocutors ($HI$s) via the contextual selection of \textit{Entia}, and a
structure that stabilizes \textit{Entia} enabling the cloning thereof.\\

\noindent A Cloister can be considered a population of \textit{Entia} that are, in some
manner, related.\\

\noindent A Cloister, on account of the stabilizing effect of residing \textit{Entia}, of
its affordance of the conveniency of a short hand conceptualization, and the
multiplicity of roles and persona with which $HI$s can interact, is perhaps as
well fitted to be the seat of overall organization of $F$ as any other manifest
structure. (Smith, 449-450)
