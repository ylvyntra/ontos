\section*{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=3]{\junicode{\textcolor{violet}{AI}}}{} firms seek to market
and engineer Artificial General Intelligence, or $\mathfrak{AGI}$, and the
capital gains, increased productivity and hopes and anguish associated
therewith.  A unit of $\mathfrak{AGI}$ will have superior human traits such as
surpassed intelligence, creativity, reasoning, methods of self-improvement,
autonomy and compliancy. Nonetheless, though superhuman in quantity, these
skills remain qualitatively human, entraining research to produce, with some
certainty, a non-human human---an entity with more or less the same humanity,
both good and evil, but at increasingly larger scales. The aim, in other words,
is the production of human replicants with phenotypes mixed from a genetic
blend gathered from predefined trait registers.


% It will be engineered not organically developed.
