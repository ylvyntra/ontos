\section*{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=3]{\junicode{\textcolor{violet}{T}}}{he} horizon capturing the
gaze of many, if not most, AI firms and academic departments is the Opus of
Artificial General Intelligence, or \textsc{AGI}, and the hopes and anguish
associated therewith.  A unit of \textsc{AGI} will have superior human traits
such as surpassed intelligence, creativity, reasoning, methods of
self-improvement, autonomy and compliancy. Nonetheless, though superhuman in
quantity, these skills remain human qualities, entraining research paths such
that what emerges will be, with some certainty, a non-human human---an entity
with more or less the same humanity, both good and evil, but at at increasingly
larger scales---engineered not organically developed.  The aim, in other words,
is the production of human replicants with phenotypes mixed from a genetic
blend mixed from predefined trait registers.
