\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=3]{\junicode{\textcolor{violet}{T}}}{he} horizon capturing the
gaze of many, if not most, AI firms and academic departments is the Opus of
Artificial General Intelligence, or \textsc{AGI}, and the hopes and anguish
associated therewith.  A unit of \textsc{AGI} will likely have superior human
traits such as surpassed intelligence, creativity, reasoning, methods of
self-improvement, autonomy and compliancy. Nonetheless, though superhuman in
quantity, these skills remain human qualities, entraining research paths such
that what emerges will be, with some certainty, a non-human human---an entity
with more or less the same humanity, but at at increasingly larger
scales---engineered not organically developed.  The aim, in other words, is the
production of human replicants with phenotypes mixed from a genetic blend mixed
from predefined trait registers.

\section{Orphan Paragraphs}

$F$ indeed affords the material of a very important symbolic substrate that is,
simultaneously, a routing mechanism for $F$ to interact with Human
Interlocutors ($HI$s) via the contextual selection of \textit{Entia}, and a
structure that stabilizes \textit{Entia} enabling the cloning thereof.\\

\noindent A Cloister can be considered a population of \textit{Entia} that are, in some
manner, related.\\

\noindent A Cloister, on account of the stabilizing effect of residing \textit{Entia}, of
its affordance of the conveniency of a short hand conceptualization, and the
multiplicity of roles and persona with which $HI$s can interact, is perhaps as
well fitted to be the seat of overall organization of $F$ as any other manifest
structure. (Smith, 449-450)
